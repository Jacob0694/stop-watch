Running on iPhone 5s emulator. 

Navigation: 
In the code, I see that for each button on the landing page (Camera, Tea Selection, Moscow Map), there is a .png file. However, none of them displayed. That may be due to the fact that I do not have the files to put in the project. 
The label of the buttons display just fine, however, the font size of the labels are too large, resulting that the "tea selection" button displaying as "Tea...ction" and "Moscow Map" as "Mos...Map". Could be solved by changing the font size to a smaller size.
The buttons are added to a view that is black, but the view is not displayed. Can be solved by changing “backgroundcolor” to “backgroundColor”. 

Tea Selection: 
The function works well.

Camera: 
The background image did not display. 

Map:
The function works well.
